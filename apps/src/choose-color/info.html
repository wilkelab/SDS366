<h3>Graphical User Interface to Pick Colors in HCL Space</h3>

<p>Claus O. Wilke, Reto Stauffer, Achim Zeileis</p>

<p>The app visualizes colors either along the hue-chroma plane for a given luminance value or along the
luminance-chroma plane for a given hue. Colors can be entered by specifying the hue (H), chroma (C),
and luminance (L) values via sliders, by entering an RGB hex code, or by clicking on a color in the
hue-chroma or luminance-chroma plane. It is also possible to select individual colors and add them
to a palette for comparison and future reference.
