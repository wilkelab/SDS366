<h3>Check Images for Color Constraints</h3>

<p>Reto Stauffer, Claus O. Wilke, Achim Zeileis</p>

<p>A simple app that allows you to check an existing jpg/png image for (possible) color constraints. The image will be converted to protanope vision, deuteranope vision, and a desaturated version (monochromatic vision). Allows a rapid check whether the colors used in the image show some constraints with respect to color vision deficiency or color blindness.</p>

<p>Note that even though you "upload" the image the app runs entirely in your browser and the image never leaves your computer.</p>
