In this project, you will be working with a dataset of your own choosing. **Important:** The dataset needs to be picked from the TidyTuesday project [(link)](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024), and it needs to be one that has been released between May 28, 2024 and December 31, 2024 (both dates inclusive).

**Hints:**

- Read in your data with `readr::read_csv()`, as we have done in prior projects. **Do not use the tidytuesdayR package.** The TidyTuesday site explains for each dataset how it can be read with `readr::read_csv()`, under "The Data", "Option 2: Read directly from GitHub".
  
- Make sure your question is actually a question, and not a veiled instruction to perform a particular analysis.

- Remember your analysis component needs to contain one of the following: statistical modeling on subsets of data, principal components analysis, or clustering. Most students find it easiest to meet all the other project requirements with principal components analysis, so this is recommended but not required.

- For at least one plot, you have to use either faceting or color coding or both. Pick whichever you prefer. Also, at least one plot has to be a compound plot composed of two separate plots you made.

- Adjust `fig-width`, `fig-height`, and `out-width` in the chunk options to customize figure sizing and figure aspect ratios. `fig-width` and `fig-height` are given in inches and will usually be between 3 and 10. `out-width` is given in percent and will usually be between 50% and 100%.

- You can use additional R packages such as ggforce, colorspace, etc., if you find them helpful. However, please stick to packages we have discussed in class.
