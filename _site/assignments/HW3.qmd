**This homework is due on Feb. 6, 2025 at 11:00pm. Please submit as a pdf file on Canvas.**

**Problem 1: (8 pts)** For this Problem you will be working with the `penguins2` dataset which is equivalent to `penguins` but with `NA` values removed.

```{r}
penguins2
```

Use ggplot to make a histogram of the `body_mass_g` column. Manually choose appropriate values for `binwidth` and `center`. Explain your choice of values in 2-3 sentences.

```{r}
# Your code goes here.
```

*Your explanation goes here.*

**Problem 2: (6 pts)** For Problems 2 and 3, you will work with the dataset `OH_pop` that contains Ohio state demographics and has been derived from the `midwest` dataset provided by **ggplot2**. See here for details of the original dataset: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/midwest.html. `OH_pop` contains two columns: `county` and `poptotal` (the county's total population), and it only contains counties with at least 100,000 inhabitants.

```{r}
OH_pop
```

Create a plot that satisfies the following two requirements:

(a) Use ggplot to make a scatter plot of `county` vs total population (column `poptotal`) and order the counties by the total population.

(b) Rename the axes and set appropriate limits, breaks and labels. Note: Do not use `xlab()` or `ylab()` to label the axes.

```{r}
# Your code goes here.
```

**Problem 2: (6 pts)**

Modify the plot from Problem 2 so it satisfies the following two requirements:

(a) Change the scale for `poptotal` to logarithmic.

(b) Adjust the limits, breaks, and labels so they are appropriate for the logarithmic scale.

```{r}
# Your code goes here.
```
