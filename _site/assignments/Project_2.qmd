```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
# !! Do not edit this code chunk !!
library(tidyverse)
```

In this project, you will be working with a dataset about the members of Himalayan expeditions:
```{r}
#| message: false
members <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-22/members.csv')

members
```

More information about the dataset can be found at <https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-22/readme.md> and <https://www.himalayandatabase.com/>.

**Hints:**

- Make sure your two questions are actually questions, and not veiled instructions to perform a particular analysis.

- Remember your code needs to contain at least three data manipulation functions for data wrangling before you plot. You are allowed to put all the data wrangling into the answer for one of the two questions.

- You should make one plot per question.

- For at least one plot, you have to use either faceting or color coding or both. Pick whichever you prefer.

- Adjust `fig-width`, `fig-height`, and `out-width` in the chunk options to customize figure sizing and figure aspect ratios. `fig-width` and `fig-height` are given in inches and will usually be between 3 and 10. `out-width` is given in percent and will usually be between 50% and 100%.

- You can use additional R packages such as ggforce, colorspace, etc., if you find them helpful. However, please stick to packages we have discussed in class.
