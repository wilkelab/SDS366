FMHPI Definition

The Freddie Mac House Price Index (FMHPI) provides a measure of typical price inflation for houses within the United States. Values are calculated monthly and released at the end of the following month. For example, the FMHPI for March is published in late April. Series are available at three levels of geographical aggregation: Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), state, and national (US). All series begin in January 1975. The national index is defined as a weighted average of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. indices. The FMHPI is based on an ever expanding database of loans purchased by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.

Freddie Mac publishes two indexes, a seasonally adjusted (SA) and non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) house price index for each geographical area.
