We can do so by setting the argument position = position_jitter() in geom_point().\nWhen using position_jitter() we will normally have to specify how much jittering we want in the horizontal and vertical direction, by setting the width and height arguments: position_jitter(width = 0.15, height = 0). Both width and height are specified in units representing the resolution of the data points, and indicate jittering in either direction. So, if data points are 1 unit apart, then width = 0.15 means the jittering covers 0.3 units or 30% of the spacing of the data points.\nTry this for yourself, by making a strip chart with jittering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(lincoln_temps, aes(x = month, y = mean_temp)) +\n  geom_point(\n    size = 0.75,\n    position = position_jitter(___)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(lincoln_temps, aes(x = month, y = mean_temp)) +\n  geom_point(\n    size = 0.75,\n    position = position_jitter(width = 0.15, height = 0)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThe function position_jitter() applies random jittering to the data points, which means the plot looks different each time you make it.

Often, however, we encounter a slightly different scenario: A dataset doesn’t contain the numeric amounts directly, but instead contains observations we want to count. This is the case in the penguins2 dataset (see above).\nIt contains one row per penguin. If we want to make a bar plot of the number of penguins of each species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo), we cannot use geom_col() as before, because the dataset doesn’t have a column that contains these counts.\nThe solution here is to use geom_bar(), which performs a count and then displays the result of that count. Because geom_bar() counts automatically, you only have to provide it with a single aesthetic, which specifies the data column in which you are counting.\nTry this out.

    "section": "Scale customizations",
    "text": "Scale customizations\nWe can modify the appearance of the x and y axis with scale functions. All scale functions have name of the form scale_aesthetic_type(), where aesthetic stands for an aesthetic to which we’re mapping data (e.g., x, y, color, fill, etc), and type stands for the specific type of the scale. What scale types are available depends on both the aesthetic and the data.\nHere, we only consider position scales, which are scales for the x and y aesthetics. The most commonly used scales types for position scales are continuous for continuous data and discrete for discrete data, yielding the scale functions scale_x_continuous(), scale_y_continuous(), scale_x_discrete(), and scale_y_discrete(). But there are others, such as date, time, or binned. You can look them up here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-scales\nPosition scale functions are used to modify both the appearance of the axis (axis title, axis labels, number and location of breaks, etc.) and the mapping from data to position (including the range of data values considered, i.e., axis limits, and whether the data should be transformed, as is the case in log scales).\nLet’s start with this plot of the boxoffice data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use scale functions to modify the axis titles, by setting the name argument. For example, scale_x_continuous(name = \"the x value\") would set the axis title to “the x value” in a continuous scale along the x axis.\nUse the appropriate scale functions to modify both axis titles in the above plot. Think about which axes (if any) are continuous and which are discrete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(___) +\n  scale_y_discrete(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"weekend gross (million USD)\") +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL)\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use scale functions to set axis limits, via the limits argument. For continuous scales, the limits argument takes a vector of two numbers representing the lower and upper limit. For example, limits = c(0, 80) would indicate an axis that runs from 0 to 80. For discrete scales, the limits argument takes a vector of all the categories that should be shown, in the order in which they should be shown.\nTry this out by setting a limit from 0 to 80 on the x axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"weekend gross (million USD)\",\n    limits = ___\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"weekend gross (million USD)\",\n    limits = c(0, 80)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you set the axis limits such that not all data points can be shown, for example an upper limit of 65 rather than 80? Do you understand why?\n(Hint: Scale limits are applied before the plot is drawn, and data points outside the scale limits are discarded. If this is not what you want, there’s an alternative way of setting limits. See the very end of this worksheet under “Coords”.)\nNext, we can use the breaks and labels arguments to customize which axis ticks are shown and how they are labeled. In general, you need exactly as many breaks as labels. If you define only breaks but not labels then labels are automatically generated from the breaks.\nBuilding on the code from the previous example, set breaks at 0, 25, 50, and 75, and format the labels such that they can be read as currency. For example, write $25M instead of just 25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"weekend gross\",\n    limits = c(0, 80),\n    breaks = ___,\n    labels = ___\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"weekend gross\",\n    limits = c(0, 80),\n    breaks = c(0, 25, 50, 75),\n    labels = c(\"0\", \"$25M\", \"$50M\", \"$75M\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL)\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the resulting plot, you may notice that the x axis extends beyond the limits you have set. This happens because by default ggplot scales expand the axis range by a small amount. You can set the axis expansion via the expand parameter. Setting the expansion can be a bit tricky, because we can set expansion at either end of a scale and we can define both additive and multiplicative expansion. (Additive expansion adds a fixed value, whereas multiplicative expansion adds a multiple of the scale range. ggplot uses additive expansion for discrete scales and multiplicative expansion for continuous scales, but you can use either for either scale.)\nThe simplest way to define expansions is with the expansion() function, which takes arguments mult for multiplicative expansion and add for additive expansion. Either takes a vector of two values, indicating expansion at the lower and upper end, respectively. Thus, expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1)) indicates multiplicative expansion of 0% at the lower end and 10% at the upper end, whereas expansion(add = c(2, 2)) indicates additive expansion of 2 units at either end of the scale.\nTry this yourself. Use the expand argument to remove the gap to the left of 0 on the x axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"weekend gross\",\n    limits = c(0, 80),\n    breaks = c(0, 25, 50, 75),\n    labels = c(\"0\", \"$25M\", \"$50M\", \"$75M\"),\n    expand = expansion(___)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"weekend gross\",\n    limits = c(0, 80),\n    breaks = c(0, 25, 50, 75),\n    labels = c(\"0\", \"$25M\", \"$50M\", \"$75M\"),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.06))\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL)\n\n\n\n\nTry different settings for the expand argument.

    "text": "Coords\nWhile scales determine how data values are mapped and represented along one dimension, e.g. the x or the y axis, coordinate systems define how these dimensions are projected onto the 2d plot surface. The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system, which uses orthogonal x and y axes. In the following example, I have added the coord explicitly, but this is not normally necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can however add a different coord, for example coord_polar() to use a polar coordinate system. Try this out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  coord_polar()\n\n\n\n\nIn the polar coordinate system, the y axis (here, temperature) is mapped onto the radius, and the x axis (here, day of year) is mapped onto the angle. You can use scale_x_continuous() and scale_y_continuous() to modify the radial and angular axes. For example, you may want to change the temperature limits from 0 to 105 so the temperature curve for Chicago doesn’t hit the exact center of the plot. Try this out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  coord_polar() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = ___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(temperatures, aes(day_of_year, temperature, color = location)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  coord_polar() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 105))\n\n\n\n\nThere are other useful coords. For example, coord_fixed() is a Cartesian coordinate system with fixed aspect ratio. This is useful when we plot variables along the x and y axes that are measured in the same units. In this case, we want the two axes to be coordinated, such that one step along x has the same meaning as one step along y.\nTo demonstrate this, we reshape the temperatures dataset into wide format, and then plot temperatures in San Diego versus temperatures in Houston.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(A side remark: Do you know why we write `San Diego` and not \"San Diego\" or 'San Diego' inside the aes() function? If you don’t, see if you can find out.)\nThe units along both the x and the y axis are temperatures, but a 10 degree difference in Houston is shown as a shorter distance than a 10 degree difference in San Diego. To address this problem, add coord_fixed() to the above plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(temps_wide, aes(`San Diego`, Houston)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is technically correct but it doesn’t look good, because breaks are spaced differently along the two axes. Also, the plot looks strangely narrow and tall. We can fix both issues by manually setting breaks and limits for both axes. Try this out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(temps_wide, aes(`San Diego`, Houston)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = ___,\n    breaks = ___\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = ___,\n    breaks = ___\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(temps_wide, aes(`San Diego`, Houston)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = c(45, 85),\n    breaks = c(40, 50, 60, 70, 80)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(48, 88),\n    breaks = c(50, 60, 70, 80)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nFinally, as the last example of what can be done with coords, we go back to the problem of setting limits on the box-office bar plot. Instead of setting limits with scale functions, we can also set them via the arguments xlim and ylim inside the coord, for example here coord_cartesian(). (This would be a good reason to explicity add coord_cartesian() to a plot.) When we set limits in the coord ggplot does not discard any data points. Instead it simply zooms in or out according to the limits set. Try this out by setting the x limits from 10 to 65 in the box-office plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_cartesian(\n    xlim = ___\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(boxoffice) +\n  aes(amount, fct_reorder(title, amount)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_cartesian(\n    xlim = c(10, 65)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nNote: It is normally not a good idea to start a bar plot at a value other than 0. This exercise was solely meant to demonstrate how limits in coords differ from limits in scales."

What if we wanted San Diego to be shown in green and Chicago in blue? The simplest way to resolve this issue is to use a named vector. A named vector in R is a vector where each value has a name. Named vectors are created by writing c(name1 = value1, name2 = value2, ...). See the following example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe names in the second example are A, B, and C.

They are extreme points in the RGB color space and tend to look unnatural and cheap. Try this by making a swatch plot of these colors, and compare for example to the color scale containing the colors \"firebrick\", \"springgreen4\", \"blue3\", \"turquoise3\", \"darkorchid2\", \"gold2\".

    "section": "Assignments and grading",
    "text": "Assignments and grading\nThe graded components of this class will be homeworks, projects, peer-grading, and participation. Each week either a homework, a project, or a peer-grading is due. Homeworks will be relatively short visualization problems to be solved by the student, usually involving some small amount of programming to achieve a specified goal. They are graded by the TA. Projects are larger and more involved data analysis problems that involve both programming and writing. They are peer-graded by the students. Students will have at least one week to complete each homework and two weeks to complete each project. The submission deadlines for homeworks and projects will be Thursdays at 11pm.\nThere will be seven homeworks and three projects. Both homeworks and projects need to be submitted electronically on Canvas. Homeworks are worth 20 points and projects are worth 100 points. The lowest-scoring homework will be dropped, so that a maximum of 120 points can be obtained from the homeworks.\nProjects are peer-graded, which involves evaluating three projects by other students according to a detailed grading rubric that will be provided. The final grade for each project is the mean of the peer-graded projects, subject to oversight and potential grade correction (up or down, as warranted) by the TA. The peer-grading itself will also be graded by the TA. Experience has shown that peer-grading is often the most instructive component of this class, so don’t take this lightly.\nParticipation is assessed in two ways. First, students will receive 2 points for every lecture they attend. This is tracked via simple quizzes on Canvas. Second, each week students can receive up to 4 points for making substantive contributions to the Canvas online discussion (2 points per contribution). Total participation points are capped at 52 (13 weeks of class times 4 points), so students can compensate for lack of in-person attendance by participating in discussions and vice versa. You do not have to get full points in both in-person attendance and online discussions. No participation is assessed in the first week of class.\n\n\n\nAssignment type\nNumber\nPoints per assignment\nTotal points\n\n\n\n\nHomework\n6 (+1)\n20\n120\n\n\nProject\n3\n100\n300\n\n\nPeer grading\n3\n16\n48\n\n\nParticipation\n26 (+26)\n2\n52\n\n\n\nThus, in summary, each project (+ peer grading) contributes 22% to the final grade, the totality of all homeworks contributes another 23% to the final grade, and participation contributes 10%. There are no traditional exams in this class and there is no final.\nThe class will use +/- grading, and the exact grade boundaries will be determined at the end of the semester. However, the following minimum grades will be guaranteed:\n\n\n\nPoints achieved\nMinimum guaranteed grade\n\n\n\n\n468 (90%)\nA-\n\n\n416 (80%)\nB-\n\n\n364 (70%)\nC-\n\n\n260 (50%)\nD-"

Late submissions will result in 0 points for the peer-grading effort.\nIn case of illness or other unforeseen circumstances out of your control, please reach out to Claus Wilke as soon as possible. We will consider your request on a case-by-case basis. If you need a deadline extension for valid reasons, please reach out before the official submission deadline and state how much of an extension you would need.

We encourage you to communicate with other students, in particular through the discussion forums on Canvas. However, there are times when you need to demonstrate your own ability to work and solve problems. In particular, your homeworks and projects are independent work, unless explicitly stated otherwise. You are allowed to confer with fellow students about general approaches to solve the problems in the assignments, but you have to do the assignments on your own and describe your work in your own words. Students who violate these expectations can expect to receive a failing grade on the assignment and will be reported to Student Judicial Services. These types of violations are reported to professional schools, should you ever decide to apply one day. Don’t do it—it’s not worth the consequences."

In this class, you are allowed to use such tools as an aid for completing your assignments. However, you are ultimately responsible for the work you deliver. If the Generative AI makes mistakes, such as using R packages that are not permitted, violating design principles that have been discussed in class, or generally producing sub-standard assignments, that is on you. Your assignments will be graded accordingly.\nWe would also like to offer some words of caution. Given the depth and specific attention that this course places on effective visualization, current AI tools will frequently produce bad results that are not up to the standards expected in this class. In addition, the code produced will often not follow the approaches shown in slides or worksheets and will be difficult for your peers to grade. These deficits will become apparent especially as we transition into more complex assignments and projects.\nMore generally, you will only get out of this class as much as you invest into it, and overly relying on AI tools will prevent you from building skills needed later in the class and will cause you to struggle as the complexity and depth of the course content increases."

To the extent that your note-taking technology creates any sort of recordings of class materials, see the next point.\nUse of technology to audio record during class. You are welcome to record audio, for your own personal use as a study aid. Audio recordings should not be shared or otherwise made available to third parties. Be aware that the section in the syllabus about class recordings applies to any personal recordings you may be making.\nA copy of class notes from a volunteer. I am happy to ask whether there are any volunteers willing to share class notes.\nAccess to materials shown in class. All materials are posted either on Canvas or on the class website, https://wilkelab.org/SDS366.\nFlexibility with deadlines. The amount of flexibility we can provide is strongly constrained by the class structure. We cannot accept homework submissions after the assignment has been graded and solutions have been released. This will typically happen 2-3 days after the original deadline. We cannot accept project submissions after the project has been released for peer grading. This will happen 2 days after the original deadline. In all cases, if you need a deadline extension please reach out on Canvas as early as possible (ideally before the deadline has passed) and ask for a specific amount of time you would like to have added to the deadline. (Example: “Could I have a deadline extension of one day?”) Mention in your message that you have an approved accommodation for flexibility with deadlines. You do not need to explain why you need the extension.\nPlease note that deadline extensions should be occasional, one-off events. I will not approve a blanket deadline extension for all assingments throughout the semester. I also encourage you to manage your deadlines proactively. Materials for homework assignments will be posted at least one week before the deadline, and materials for projects will be posted at least two weeks before the deadline. This should give you plenty of time to complete your assignments early and not push things to the last minute.\nFlexibility with attendance. Regular attendance is a component of the overall grade in this class. However, you are not required to attend every single lecture. You can make up for missed lectures by participating in the online discussions on Canvas instead. See the participation component of the class grade described in the syllabus."

The difference is that when you use an aesthetic as a parameter, you specify a specific value, such as color = \"blue\", rather than a mapping, such as aes(color = location). Notice the difference: Inside the aes() function, we don’t actually specify the specific color values, ggplot does that for us. We only say that we want the data values of the location column to correspond to different colors. (We will learn later how to tell ggplot to use specific colors in this mapping.)\nTry this with the boxplot example from the previous section.

For example, ~class means draw a separate panel for each class, ~survived means draw a separate panel for each survival status, and ~class + survived means draw a separate panel for each combination of class and survival status.\nAs an example, the following code generates small multiple histograms by class:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow use the same principle to draw small multiple histograms by survival status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~survived)\n\n\n\n\nNow make a plot that breaks down the data by both survival status and class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, do the same but drawing density plots rather than histograms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age)) +\n  ___ +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"cornsilk\", bw = 2) +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)\n\n\n\n\notice the difference between this plot and the corresponding histogram plot. Histograms show absolute counts whereas the density plots are normalized so that the area under the curve is 1. As a consequence, the density plot does not provide an accurate representation of the number of passengers in each grouping. This can be changed. See next section."

    "text": "Manipulating stats\nYou may have noticed that neither geom_histogram() nor geom_density() require you to define an aesthetic mapping for the y variable. This is because under the hood, a statistical transformation (called a “stat”) calculates the histogram or density from the raw data and then sets the appropriate y mapping.\nSometimes it can be useful to access or modify this mapping directly. We tell ggplot that we want to map a value calculated by a stat, rather than one that is in the original data, by writing after_stat(...) inside the aes() function. So, for example, the default y mapping for geom_density() is y = after_stat(density). An alternative mapping, y = after_stat(count) scales densities by the number of points in each grouping, thus producing something more similar to a histogram. You can see the difference between these two choices in the following two examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same options of after_stat(count) and after_stat(density) exist for geom_histogram() as well. Try this by making histograms that use the calculated density for the y value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age, y = ___)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age, y = after_stat(density))) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)\n\n\n\n\nNow, instead, try mapping the calculated counts onto the fill aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age, fill = ___)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age, fill = after_stat(count))) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, center = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can make our own combination of geoms and stats, by setting the stat argument of a geom, e.g. stat = \"density\" to use the density stat. To try this out, draw a density plot using geom_point(), and also map the calculated density values onto the point color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age, color = ___)) +\n  geom_point(stat = \"density\") +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(age, color = after_stat(density))) +\n  geom_point(stat = \"density\") +\n  facet_wrap(~survived + class)"
